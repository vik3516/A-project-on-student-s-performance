# A-project-on-student-s-performance
 This project aims to explore the relationship between students' lifestyles, study techniques, and their performance scores. Based on this relationship, I will develop a model designed to predict student performance and achieve the most accurate results possible.

This project uses the multilinear regression for training the model, and evaluating the result. 

# Summary
 # Residual Analysis:

Residuals followed a normal distribution, supported by a high p-value of 0.98.
# Model Evaluation:

1. The model's performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
2. The average Mean Squared Error (MSE) from the cross-validation was 4.15, indicating consistent accuracy across various data subsets.
3. The model achieved an impressive RÂ² score of 0.99 on the test set, demonstrating its robust capability to explain the variability in the "Performance Index."
# Conclusion:

These findings collectively affirm that the model performs exceptionally well in predicting the dependent variable with high accuracy and reliability.
